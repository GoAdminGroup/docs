# Introduction
------

GoAdmin is a framework, providing a complete set of visual UI calls to golang programs, and a built-in sql relational database management backend plugin.
<br>
<br>
In the past, when we try to build an administrative platform, we needed at least one backend IT engineer, a front-end IT engineer, taking at least a week work.
Now with GoAdmin, we don't need front-end IT engineers. Our back-end IT engineers don't even need to know the front-end knowledge. We can build a complete administrative platform or a data visualization platform in half an hour.
If your requirements are not so complicated, just simple crud, then all you need are serveral golang files, and all files can be packaged into a single binary file, which is very convenient for distribution and deployment.

Here is a super simple example which quickly shows you how it works: [https://github.com/GoAdminGroup/example](https://github.com/GoAdminGroup/example)
